    <p>My name is Bryce Desrochers. I was the inspiration behind the 2<sup>nd</sup> fully accessible baseball diamond in Canada, it is called The Miracle League of Ottawa. Through this project I developed my inspirational saying. My inspirational saying is. <blockquote><em>If you say your dreams out loud they will usually come true.</em> -<cite>Bryce Desrochers</cite></blockquote></p>
    <p>Another thing about me is my sports life. When I was 6 years old, I played my first sport, Sledge Hockey. In sledge hockey I was apart of <abbr title="Sledge Hockey of Eastern Ontario"></abbr> SHEO. My sledge hockey career lasted from 2008 to 2018. Next sport I would play is baseball. My baseball career started in 2012 and continues today. Lastly, a sport in which I hope to get to the big stage, the Paralympics, is called Boccia. Boccia is sport that I strive in because if I do everything correctly, this means 2028 Summer Paralympics Games in Los Angeles. I hope to be wearing the maple leaf on my heart representing Team Canada in the wonderful sport of Boccia. </p>
